    <p>A measles outbreak <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/it-will-take-off-like-a-wildfire-the-unique-dangers-of-the-washington-state-measles-outbreak/2019/02/06/cfd5088a-28fa-11e9-b011-d8500644dc98_story.html?utm_term=.85cef1950a23" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this year in Washington state</a> and another two years ago that started in <a href="http://www.startribune.com/measles-outbreak-is-over-state-health-officials-say/441764203/">Hennepin County</a> have raised new attention on communities that have low vaccination rates.</p>

    <p>The Hennepin County outbreak, that sickened 79 people, shed light on low vaccination rates among children in the Twin Cities Somali community, where immunizations plummeted after a discredited rumor several years ago that vaccines can cause autism.</p>

    <p>This year&rsquo;s outbreak is centered in Clark County, Wash., a suburban area of Portland, which has been called an anti-vaccination &ldquo;hot spot&rdquo; since only about 75 percent of kindergartners are vaccinated against measles. This is well below the 95 percent rate experts say is necessary for so-called &ldquo;herd immunity.&rdquo; Unvaccinated individuals are protected from infection when almost everyone around them has been vaccinated.</p>

    <p>Data from the Minnesota Department of Health on <a href="http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/idepc/immunize/stats/school/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccination rates in public and private schools</a> and <a href="http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/idepc/immunize/stats/childcare/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">child care centers</a> show that there are similar pockets of low vaccination rates throughout the state.</p>

    <p>There are just over 600 public or private schools with measles vaccination rates below 95 percent, including some below 50 percent.</p>

    <p>Among the state&rsquo;s currently licensed 1,700 child care centers, there are more than 300 that have measles vaccination rates below 95 percent, including some as low as 30 percent. There are also about 300 facilities that did not report in 2017-18, the most recent year of data available.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.startribune.com/at-minnesota-day-cares-troubling-gaps-in-immunization-coverage/425025873/">Two years ago</a>, state health officials said it has been challenging to get child care centers to report vaccination rates. Half of the people sickened in the Hennepin County outbreak may have caught the measles at day care centers, and many passed it on to other unvaccinated family members.</p>
